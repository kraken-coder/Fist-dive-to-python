#  if / else conditions are used to decide to do something based on a conditionaly

x = 20
y = 20
# comparison operators. Used to compare

#  if /else
# if x > y:
#     print(f'{x} is greater than{y}')
# else:
#     print(f"{y} is  greater that {x}")

#  if else elseif
# if x > y:
#     print(f'{x} is greater than{y}')

# elif y == x:
#     print(f'both are equal')
# else:
#     print(f"{y} is  greater that {x}")

#  nested conditional 
# if x > 3:
#     if x <= 10:
#         print(f'{x} is greater but less than 10')
#     else:
#         print(f'No conditional meet')

# cleaner and more elegant way 

# if x > 5 and x < 21:
    # print(f'{x} is between 10 - 20')

# or
# if x > 5 or x < 21:
#     print(f'{x} is between 10 - 20')

# #  mot
# if not (x == y):
#     print('true')
# else:
#     print('false')

#  membership operators
numbers = [1, 2, 4, 5]

#  in 
# if x in numbers:
#     print(x in numbers)

#  not in
# if x not in numbers:
    # print(x not in numbers)


# identity operators
#  is
# if x is y:
#     print(x is y)

#  is not 

if x is not y:
    print(x is not y)
